# Machine-learning-algorithms-to-predict-obesity

Overview
This repository contains machine learning models developed to predict obesity using Python. The models were tested on Windows 11 with Python version 3.12.

Dependencies
The exercise utilized Python for model creation, leveraging the libraries provided by Anaconda. The key libraries employed in this project include:

pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.

matplotlib.pyplot: Employed for data visualization through graphs and visualizations.

scikit-learn (sklearn): A machine learning library that offers tools for classification, regression, clustering, and more. Specifically, the following components were used:

train_test_split: Utilized to split the dataset into training and testing sets.
StandardScaler: Applied for feature standardization (normalization).
MLPClassifier: A classifier based on artificial neural networks, where MLP stands for "Multilayer Perceptron."
accuracy_score: Used to calculate the model accuracy.
confusion_matrix: Applied for calculating the confusion matrix.
classification_report: Generates a classification metrics report.
joblib: Utilized for the persistence of Python objects, enabling the saving and loading of trained models, among other functionalities.

numpy: Fundamental for matrix and numerical operations in Python, playing a crucial role in machine learning for efficient data manipulation and vectorized calculations.

Usage
To replicate or extend the analysis, follow these steps:

Ensure you have Python version 3.12 installed.
Install Anaconda to access the required libraries.
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Run the provided Python scripts for model creation and evaluation.
Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your specific requirements.
